# Introduction 
Luci is my Discord bot for L2R. It uses a packet logger to decrypt packets asyncronosly and provide in-game information to Discord channels. Requires https://github.com/bekim-gjokaj/l2r-packet-logger which I have included in the solution as a nuget package.

# Build and Test
.Net Core app
